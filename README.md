# ADE 

## Transition to wayland
ADE will use wayland instead of Arcan as window server, following the 1.11.25.

## Experimental release
A first experimental alpha release using wayland, will be published around the 26.12.25. This release will focus on getting a single, high performance desktop application to run stable. To achieve this, the experimental "desktop" environment EADEW, will be introduced. In addition the ADE-utils repository, will be further developed to a state serving the purpose of the release.
